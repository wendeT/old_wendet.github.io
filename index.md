## Welcome to my-github page
I am a student in Information Science (Language Technology), taking courses on AI, machine learning and computational linguistics (Natural Language Processing, machine translation based on neural networks, and Image Processing). Currently I am working on a master's thesis in Computational Morphology using techniques from linguistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence.

## My research
My research interests are rooted in two major problems my country is faced with: multilinguality,hence potential communication problems, and access (in our language) to universal knowledge, hence the problem of being left behind. I live in Ethiopia, a country where more than 80 languages are spoken.Since all of them are under-resourced, I have decided to work on the one that is most widely spoken,Amharic. For the time being I focus only on morphology and phonology. More precisely, I am working
on a morphological analyzer and a POS tagger which are crucial components for the development of any NLP system (Machine translation, Natural Language Generation and Understanding, etc.), in particular for morphologically rich languages like Amharic.
